The Unsplash integration allows you to automatically fetch and display high-quality photos from Unsplash based on your search queries. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create an Unsplash Developer Account

2. Click "Register as a developer"
3. Fill out the registration form and agree to the terms
4. Once registered, click "Your apps"
5. Click "New Application"

## 2. Create Your Application

1. Fill in your application details:
   - Application name: "Photo Frame Server" (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "Digital photo frame server that displays Unsplash photos"

## 4. Usage Guidelines

To comply with Unsplash's attribution requirements:
