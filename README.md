# Photo Frame Assistant

A powerful and feature-rich server application for managing digital photo frames, photo collections, and automated image generation.

![Photo Frame Assistant](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Photo+Frame+Assistant)

A powerful self-hosted platform for managing digital photo frames, collections, and AI-generated imagery—all with privacy at its core. Easily deploy on a Raspi or your local server.

## Overview
Photo Frame Assistant (PFA) is the digital photo frame solution that puts you in control. It transforms how you display cherished memories throughout your home by seamlessly orchestrating multiple frames—from energy-efficient e-ink displays to vibrant screens with video support—all while keeping your photos private and secure on your own network.

PFA bridges the convenience gap between proprietary cloud solutions and DIY setups, providing automated content management, intelligent frame coordination, and deep smart home integration without compromising on privacy. Connect with your existing photo libraries, generate custom AI imagery, or automatically sync from network folders—then let PFA handle the rest.

##Why Photo Frame Assistant?
Today's digital frame market forces unnecessary compromises:

Privacy concerns: Commercial products often lock your memories behind proprietary clouds
Limited control: Most frames offer minimal customization and lack advanced scheduling
Disconnected experiences: Frames operate in isolation rather than as coordinated displays
Management headaches: Adding new content becomes a tedious, manual process
Smart home isolation: Frames rarely integrate with your existing home automation

PFA delivers the complete solution by combining:
Self-hosted privacy: Keep your photos on your own server, not someone else's cloud
Unified management: Control all your frames from a single dashboard
Smart synchronization: Coordinate frames into groups for consistent viewing experiences
Effortless content updates: Automatically import from network folders, cloud services, or AI generation
Deep integration: Connect with Home Assistant via MQTT for true smart home experiences

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

#### How can I build my own photo frame for Photo Frame Assistant?
You can build your own photo frame using various hardware options:
1. **Raspberry Pi + Display**: Use a Raspberry Pi (3B+, 4, or Zero 2W) with an e-ink, LCD, or OLED display.
2. **Repurposed Tablet**: Convert an old tablet into a dedicated photo frame by installing our client app.
3. **ESP32 + Display**: For battery-operated frames, an ESP32 with an e-ink display offers excellent power efficiency.
4. **Smart TVs (Browser-supported Devices)**: Frame TVs and smart speakers can support Photo Frame Assistant using our local client frame.

#### Can Photo Frame Assistant work with a device that is not on my network?
Yes. Use services like Cloudflare Tunnel or Ngrok to securely expose your Photo Frame Assistant server to the internet. For security, we recommend using a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS encryption when exposing your server to the internet.

#### How does the battery life work for battery-operated frames?
Battery life depends on several factors:
- **Display Technology**: E-ink displays consume power only when changing images, offering weeks of battery life.
- **Sleep Settings**: Deep sleep mode significantly extends battery life by putting the frame to sleep during specified hours.
- **Wake Frequency**: Less frequent wake cycles (longer sleep intervals) preserve battery life.
- **Hardware**: Different microcontrollers and displays have varying power requirements.

#### Can I use Photo Frame Assistant with commercial photo frames?
Yes, in several ways:
1. **API Integration**: Some commercial frames offer APIs that Photo Frame Assistant can use.
2. **Email Integration**: For frames that accept photos via email, you can configure automatic email forwarding.
3. **Custom Firmware**: For some models, we provide custom firmware that enables direct integration.

#### What's the difference between sync groups and individual frame management?
- **Individual Management**: Each frame has its own playlist, settings, and wake schedule.
- **Sync Groups**: Frames in a sync group share the same content and wake at synchronized times, ensuring consistent displays across multiple frames.

Use sync groups when you want multiple frames to show the same photos (like in different rooms of a house), and individual management when each frame should display different content.

#### How do I add photos from my phone automatically?
Several options are available:
1. **Mobile App**: Use the Photo Frame Assistant webapp to upload photos directly.
2. **Cloud Integration**: Connect Google Photos or Immich to automatically import photos.
3. **Network Folder**: Set up a watched folder that automatically imports new photos.
4. **Auto-Import from Network Shares**: Configure a network share with auto-import enabled, then save photos from your phone to that network location.

#### Can I display videos on my photo frames?
Yes, Photo Frame Assistant supports video playback on compatible frames. Videos can be:
- Uploaded directly through the web interface
- Imported from Google Photos
- Displayed on frames with video playback capabilities

#### Can I control my photo frames through Home Assistant?
Yes, using the MQTT integration you can connect PFA directly to Home Assistant. Once connected, you are able to control what photos are up next on the display, see diagnostic information, add frames as part of scences or automations. For example, when a specific homehold member walks into a room, frames can change to pictures of loved ones. When your favorite album is played on a music source, the frames can change to photos of the band.

#### Can I connect Photo Frame Assistant to my Smart TV or (multimodal) Smart Speaker?
Yes. Simply add a local frame client (under Frame settings) and go to the local frame client website on your TV. When adding a local client you can define the client's capabilities (resolution, video support, etc). Once you create a client you are no longer able to edit its capabilities.
